## Vim with your soul like ether (Updated Dec 14, 2020)

>There is a day in the life of a man when he realizes that the traditional way of using a computer is flawed, that graphical interfaces were a bad idea, that the mouse is an absurd invention, that a life away from the home row is not a life worth living. -- Pablo Arias

My `dotfiles` repo is private but my full vim configs are available as Gists (pinned below & hopefully up-to-date). There is quite a bit going on in my runtime path files which are not shared. I may add most of the `rtp` files as Gists or make my dotfiles public. 

Tip of the year: **FZF** all the things -> https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim
