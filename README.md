## neoVim with your soul like ether (Updated Mar 31, 2021)

>There is a day in the life of a man when he realizes that the traditional way of using a computer is flawed, that graphical interfaces were a bad idea, that the mouse is an absurd invention, that a life away from the home row is not a life worth living. -- Pablo Arias

My `dotfiles` repo is private but some of my vim configs are available as Gists (pinned below & hopefully up-to-date). There is quite a bit going on in my runtime path files which are not shared. I may add more of the `rtp` files as Gists or make my dotfiles public. 

Life-Changing Neovim Plugin: https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-compe "Auto completion plugin for nvim that written in Lua."  -- better than `nvim-lua/completion-nvim` as of this writing. Take the defaults and prepare yourself to be amazed.
